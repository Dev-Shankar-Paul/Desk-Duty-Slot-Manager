# Desk-Duty-Slot-Manager
Consists of a python script to create random slots for desk duties based on their free slots

## Libraries used to run this python script:
1) Openpyxl
2) os
3) xlrd
4) random 
5) selenium
6) time

xlrd is used to read the excel sheet of data whereas openpyxl is used to write data to the output excel sheet('test.xlsx') based on the template excel sheet('Template.xlsx'). Selenium is used to send whatsapp messages to everyone to remind them regarding their slots, using whatsapp web.

## Use case
This project was made as an attempt to automate the task of allocating slots for desk-duties (which is quite cumbersome to be done manually) during my time as a fresher at IEEE-VIT. While this project is not at all industrially inclined, it just shows how you can automate your boring everyday tasks with python.
